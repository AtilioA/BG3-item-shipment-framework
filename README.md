# Aether & Volitio's Item Shipment Framework
The Item Shipment Framework (ISF for short) allows mod authors to directly ship vanilla or modded items into the camp chest or player inventories. It is an alternative to the popular Tutorial Chest and Trader Inventory item shipment approaches. It should serve as a way for users to interact with these items more reliably and less confusingly.

When users first load into the game with this mod installed, all four potential camp chests will receive the Item Shipment Framework Mailbox. This mailbox is the main location where mod authors will send their items to users, however, authors can additionally choose to place items directly into the inventory of the host player of the game session.

Users will also find the Item Shipment Framework Utilities scroll case inside the mailbox, which houses various utility scrolls that trigger commands for the framework, as well as an automatically refilling Tutorial Chest. You can see a list of the Utility scrolls and how they function in the images section of this mod page.

If you'd like to find out how to integrate this framework with your mods, check out the [Aether & Volitio's Item Shipment Framework Wiki](https://github.com/AtilioA/BG3-item-shipment-framework/wiki).
